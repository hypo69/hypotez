### `campaign`  
 
The `campaign` module is designed to manage the process of creating and publishing advertising campaigns on Facebook.  
It includes functionality for initializing campaign parameters (name, language, currency), creating directory structures, saving configurations for the new campaign, collecting and saving product data via `ali` or `html`, generating promotional materials, reviewing the campaign, and publishing it on Facebook.

```

 - **Step 1**: Start - The process begins.

 - **Step 2**: Initialize Campaign Details - The campaign name, language, and currency are defined. Example: Campaign Name: "Summer Sale," Language: "English," Currency: "USD"

 - **Step 3**: Create Campaign and Category Directories - The necessary directories or files for the campaign are established. Example: A folder structure is created on the file system to hold campaign assets.

 - **Step 4**: Save Campaign Configuration - The initialized campaign details are saved. Example: Data is written to a database or configuration file.

 - **Step 5**: Collect Product Data - Data related to the products to be promoted within the campaign is gathered. Example: Product IDs, descriptions, images, and prices are fetched from an inventory system.

 - **Step 6**: Save Product Data - The collected product data is stored. Example: Data is written to a database table dedicated to campaign products.

 - **Step 7**: Create Promotional Materials - Graphics, banners, and other promotional assets are generated or selected. Example: Images and descriptions are tailored to attract customers.

 - **Step 8**: Review Campaign - A review process confirms the campaign's components are ready. Example: A human or system review assesses the quality and completeness of all campaign components.

 - **Step 9**: Is Campaign Ready? - A check to determine if the campaign is complete and ready for publishing. Example: A boolean flag signals "Yes" if everything is in place, otherwise "No" triggering a loop back to a previous step for corrections.

 - **Step 10**: Publish Campaign - The campaign is made live on the platform, ready for marketing efforts. Example: API calls are made to publish the campaign to the relevant platform.

 - **Step 11**: End - The campaign creation process is complete.
