# Service Folder

This is a service folder containing sample files:

- `credentials.kdbx` — a password database in the KeePass format.
- `password.txt` — a text file containing the password.
- JSON files for Google API.

## Data Format in `credentials.kdbx`

The `credentials.kdbx` file serves as a password database in the KeePass format. It contains sensitive credentials used for various APIs and services. Below are the main groups and fields expected in the database:

### Groups and Their Contents

1. **Suppliers > Aliexpress > API**
   - `api_key`: API key for accessing the Aliexpress API.
   - `secret`: Secret key for the Aliexpress API.
   - `tracking_id`: Tracking ID.
   - `email`: Email address for the Aliexpress account.
   - `password`: Password for the Aliexpress account.

2. **OpenAI**
   - `api_key`: API key for accessing OpenAI.
   - Additional properties may be defined for specific project settings.

3. **Gemini**
   - `api_key`: API key for accessing Gemini.

4. **Discord**
   - `application_id`: Discord application ID.
   - `public_key`: Public key for the Discord application.
   - `bot_token`: Discord bot token.

5. **Telegram**
   - Tokens and settings for the Telegram bot.

6. **Prestashop**
   - **Translations**
     - `server`: Database server address.
     - `port`: Port for connecting to the database.
     - `database`: Name of the database.
     - `user`: Username for connecting to the database.
     - `password`: Password for connecting to the database.
   - **Clients**
     - Each client stores its connection parameters.

7. **SMTP**
   - Each entry contains SMTP server parameters:
     - `server`: SMTP server address.
     - `port`: SMTP server port.
     - `user`: Username for SMTP.
     - `password`: Password for SMTP.

8. **Facebook**
   - Each entry contains:
     - `app_id`: Facebook application ID.
     - `app_secret`: Facebook application secret.
     - `access_token`: Access token for working with the Facebook API.

9. **Google API (GAPI)**
   - `api_key`: API key for accessing Google API.

### Important Notes

- The `password.txt` file contains a single line with the password for accessing the `credentials.kdbx` database. It is essential that the **first line** contains **only** the password. 
- It is recommended to delete the `password.txt` file from computers that can be accessed by unauthorized users.
- When changing the database password manually, the `password.txt` file must also be updated manually. **This is MANDATORY!**
- Ensure that the structure and group names match the expected format so that the application can correctly load the sensitive data.

## Initial Setup

Before starting to work and program in the system, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Create the `secrets` folder**:
   - Open your file explorer and navigate to the root of your project.
   - Right-click in an empty space in the directory and choose **New** → **Folder**.
   - Name the folder `secrets`.

2. **Copy the files**:
   - Find the file `credentials.kdbx.example` in the current directory.
   - Right-click on the file and select **Copy**.
   - Navigate to the `secrets` folder you just created, right-click inside the folder, and select **Paste**.
   
3. **Rename the copied files**:
   - In the `secrets` folder, right-click on the file `credentials.kdbx.example`.
   - Select **Rename** and remove the `.example` suffix, so the file name becomes `credentials.kdbx`.

4. **Create the `password.txt` file**:
   - In the `secrets` folder, right-click on an empty space and choose **New** → **Text Document**.
   - Name the document `password.txt`.
   - Open the file, paste the password for the `credentials.kdbx` database in the first line, and save the file. **Note:** This is a security vulnerability, so it's better not to store passwords in plain text. If the program cannot find this file or it contains an incorrect password, it will prompt you to enter the password via the command line.

### PowerShell Commands

Alternatively, you can perform these operations using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
# Create the 'secrets' folder in the root of the project
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".\secrets"

# Copy the example file to the 'secrets' folder
Copy-Item -Path ".\templates\credentials.kdbx.example" -Destination ".\secrets\credentials.kdbx"

```
